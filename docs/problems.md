### A decent loudspeaker management system costs a fortune.
You could get a cheap one like the Behringer DCX2496, but then you wont get ethernet, an Android app or AGC (Automatic Gain Control). Or you could buy a more expensive one, like the DBX VENU360. But what happens if you forget to enable the AGC in advance? Well, then you have to live without it. Because enabling it will cause a 30 second mute. This might be okay when doing an install, but it is unacceptable if you work in the event industry and have a tight schedule and needs to do some tweaks mid-gig.

### Most digital mixers are really limited in routing capabilities
Need a complex surround setup? Too bad, the routing capabilities in affordable digital mixers are crap.

### Most digital mixers don't have a built in LMS
Why the heck do I need both a digital mixer *and* an LMS? The digital mixer have all the necessary hardware and a DSP powerful enough to do both. I do realise that a factory reset on the mixer could potentially destroy speakers. But it should still be up to me to decide.
